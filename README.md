# 👋 Hi, I’m McMonds
A CSE student learning by doing — building, breaking, and fixing things one commit at a time.

## About me
I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student who learns best by building real stuff. I enjoy turning ideas into small projects, exploring new tech stacks, and improving my code with every iteration.

---

- 🌱 Learning: Systems programming, web3.0 development, and DevOps practices
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer learning by doing — experiments 

---

## Skills & Tools
- Languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), HTML/CSS ,Rust
- Tools & Tech: Git, Docker, Linux, VS Code, REST APIs, Antigravity, Figma
- Learning: Kubernetes, CI/CD, Rust (exploring), Pennetration Testing
-

## How I learn
I follow a loop: pick a goal → prototype quickly → break it intentionally → read docs & debug → iterate.
This keeps ideas small and feedback fast.


My favorite resources:
- Official docs and RFCs
- Community tutorials and small open-source projects
- Debugging and reading other people's code
- Google Database and search Engine
