# 👋 Hi, I’m McMonds
A CSE student learning by doing — building, breaking, and fixing things one commit at a time.

## About me
I'm a Computer Science & Engineering student who learns best by building real stuff. I enjoy turning ideas into small projects, exploring new tech stacks, and improving my code with every iteration.

- 🔭 Currently building: small web apps, CLI tools, and automation scripts
- 🌱 Learning: Systems programming, web development, and DevOps practices
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer learning by doing — experiments > tutorials

---

## Skills & Tools
- Languages: C, C++, Python, JavaScript (Node.js), HTML/CSS
- Tools & Tech: Git, Docker, Linux, VS Code, REST APIs
- Learning: Kubernetes, CI/CD, Rust (exploring)

---


## How I learn
I follow a loop: pick a goal → prototype quickly → break it intentionally → read docs & debug → iterate.
This keeps ideas small and feedback fast.

My favorite resources:
- Official docs and RFCs
- Community tutorials and small open-source projects
- Debugging and reading other people's code
